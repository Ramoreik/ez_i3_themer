# I3WM Better Themer

This program is made with the goal of being a simple, modular and fun i3windows manager themer.

## This program should make use of the following aesthetic technologies :

- I3 gaps

- Nitrogen

- Conky

- Compton

- X customizability ( Different X configuration files)

The goal is to make something that will be an abstraction to all the configuration that need to be done underneath and just centralize it in one spot.~~~~

i would like to add the possibility of including plugin in order for people to contribute to the project. 

The main idea is to create a main configuration file that will abstract from everything underneath.

Every technology will have their own configurations and will be executed by their own plugins. 

This way it is very modular and can be incremented really easily with the upcoming of new open-source aesthetic projects.
